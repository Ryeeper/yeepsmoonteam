      <p>The project was opened to the public today, via a post on the yeeps discord community builds channel. We already have so much interest and I'm so excited. Although slightly stressed to review so many applications.</p>

      <h2>Welcome to the Blog!</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">Posted on March 23, 2025</p>
      <p>This is the first post on the Yeep Moon Blog! Weâ€™ll use this space to post updates about the project, sneak peeks, team decisions, and more. Today and yesterday the project was created with the goal of creating the best, and hardest maps possible and giving the community something to look foward too, inspired by the envirement geometry dash gives. Right now we are laying up the ground work, and we hope it comes to fruition. We are still looking for builders and main content cordinators, but I really hope this is something that the community can bond over, if its even possible to do in this game. Oh btw, the first map is goign to be space themed, inspired by the name of the team, which itself was inspired by the <b>star</b> program. </p>
