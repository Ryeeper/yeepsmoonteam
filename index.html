      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>Hey everyone! I'm excited to officially introduce the Yeeps Moon Team, a new community-driven team aiming to create the absolute best Yeeps maps possible. Unlike BAM, we're not limited by time constraints or participant limits‚Äîinstead, we're focused purely on pushing the boundaries of difficulty, visual appeal, and fun.

          Our goal is to deliver maps that represent the pinnacle of what's achievable in Yeeps, inspired by the community-driven creativity and skill. We want to provide the Yeeps community with special maps that everyone can bond over, celebrate, and genuinely look forward to it! </p>
      <p>If you are seeing this right now, this project is still only kinda released to the public, and is still in alpha, enjoy the spoilers</p>
